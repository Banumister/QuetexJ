    <body>

        <p>QuetexJ is a Java Swing MVC sets library
            that supports pseudo endless text-component.
        <ul>
            <li>QuetexJ is useful for outputting adhoc text information
                like logging.
            <li>QuetexJ automatically chops beginning of text to free memory
                according to height of text component behind view-port.
                Of course the physical line layouts are kept.
            <li>QuetexJ works closely with vertical JScrollBar
                to keep view-port view when chopping text.
            <li>QuetexJ supports auto-tracking mode
                that always displays last part of text component to view-port.
            <li>QuetexJ includes log handler that complies with java.util.logging.
            <li>QuetexJ archive includes test-harness GUI for trial use.
        </ul>
